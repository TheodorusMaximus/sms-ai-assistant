# Text-First AI Assistant - Business Overview

## Vision Statement
"Text an AI like it's a friend â€” no apps, no logins, just send a message and get an answer back."

## Core Problem
- Apps are overwhelming or unusable in low-bandwidth environments
- Older users (boomers) and rural users need dead-simple access: texting is the universal interface
- Events, rural areas, and heavy traffic locations often kill mobile bandwidth but leave SMS working

## Solution
SMS-based AI assistant that leverages open-source personas (inspired by Tavern AI/SillyTavern) to provide helpful, contextual responses via text messaging.

## Key Innovation
**The novelty isn't the AI agent, but the vehicle and medium of exchange.** SMS provides zero-friction access that works when apps fail.

## Primary Value Propositions
1. **Zero Setup**: "If you can text, you can use it"
2. **Universal Access**: Works on flip phones, old smartphones, and anywhere with SMS signal
3. **No Tech Barriers**: No app stores, passwords, cluttered UIs, or hidden fees
4. **Reliable**: SMS works when data/LTE fails

## Target Markets
### Primary: Underserved Populations
- 65M US boomers who hate apps
- 20M rural adults with spotty data coverage
- Caregivers seeking hands-off solutions for elderly parents

### Secondary: Situational Users
- Event attendees when networks are congested
- Off-grid adventurers (BWCA, wilderness areas)
- Remote workers in low-bandwidth areas

## Business Model
**Freemium with Family Sponsorship Focus**
- Free tier: Limited messages for trials
- Basic: $4.99/mo (300 messages)
- Unlimited: $9.99/mo
- **Family Sponsor**: $7.99/mo per line (adult children pay for elderly parents)
- Prepaid bundles: $5 = 100 replies (gift cards/scratch cards)
- Crew packs: $49/mo for 10 lines (employer-sponsored)

## Success Metrics
- Unique users (by phone number)
- Queries per user per day/week
- % of users who request "MORE" (longer responses)
- Cost per active user
- Family sponsor conversion rate

## Competitive Advantage
- First-mover in SMS-only AI space for elderly/rural
- Low switching costs once adopted
- High retention through simplicity and utility
- Local/community-based acquisition strategy
