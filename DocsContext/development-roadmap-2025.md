2. **Prototype complex features** before full implementation
3. **Use managed services** to reduce operational complexity
4. **Implement monitoring early** to catch issues quickly
5. **Test thoroughly** at each phase before proceeding

### Success Metrics
- **Phase 1**: Real data collection, dashboard functionality

3. **Phase 2**: Professional monitoring + alerting
4. **Phase 3**: Payment processing + user management
5. **Phase 4**: Advanced AI + extensibility

### Budget Considerations
- **Development Time**: 475-555 hours total
